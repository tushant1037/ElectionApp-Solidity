* I used Remix IDE to build this smart contract. You can get this online IDE [here](https://remix.ethereum.org/).
* I am planning to build web application using this smart contract. but I believe in design before you build thats why i designed idea first and then implement it in smart contract.
* If you find any bug, please let me know.
